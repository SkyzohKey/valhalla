**Warning : this package is very experimental.**

# Super Vala

This package provides autocompletion for Vala in atom.

![Vala code autocompletion](https://framapic.org/fO9WNcBbybqD/fbCmOsHPXf9M)

For now, it will show you ...

- Local variables
- Namespaces that can be used, when writing a new `using` directive
- Properties and methods of a local variable (as on the screenshot), but it's quite slow for now
- Classes, when creating a new instance

It loads suggestions from .vapi files, so if you don't have anything, don't panic and try to change the settings of this package. :smile:

If you found a bug, or have suggestion please open an issue on GitHub.
